#  Sample Bourne Shell script to list a directory on the 

#  Stern Web Server
#

# Norman White, February 2013

#
#  Only works for Stern students

#  Only lists the contents of their websys subdirectory

#  Assumes the input is on the command line

#

# in the form

http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~nwhite/lsstud.cgi?fchar=a&userid=aab211

# or is passed from the web server as a "GET" action in a cgi program

#

# part 1 - Generate intro html to put in front of output

#  output the header line to tell browser what content to exp
ect
echo "Content-type: text/html"

# output a blank line after the Content-type line

echo

echo "<HTML><HEAD>"

echo "<TITLE> Directory Listing</TITLE>"

echo "</HEAD> <BODY>"

echo "<pre>"



# remove next few lines for working script

echo The arguments to the script are: $*

# Environment Variable QUERY_STRING contains form fields
echo QUERY_STRING contains $QUERY_STRING



# uncomment below for help in debugging

#set



# Tricky stuff, use sed to get rid of the & between fields

# so you have a line like:

# set fchar=a userid=aab211

# this sets local shell variables for each of the 

# form field values

# so they can be used to generate the directory path

# See http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~nwhite/websys/lsstud.html for an example form to 

# invoke this script

# note, this script MUST be named .cgi in order to be run
# on the Stern web server
# also, you need to do a chmod o+rx on it so it is executable



# The "eval" line creates a shell variable for each form field

# by issuing a 

#  field1=value1 field2=value2 etc



# The values of these variables can now be used later in the script

# by putting a $ in front of them

# "eval line echos the input line and pipes it to a sed program that changes

# & to blank, hence fchar=a&userid=aab211 becomes 

#  fchar=a userid=aab211



# Create environment variables for each form input variable

#  substitutes a " " for every "&" in QUERY_STRING and then tells the shell program
# to execute the line, thereby creating new variables for every form field (i.e. userid=aa211 fchar=a)



eval  ` ( echo $QUERY_STRING | sed -e "s/\&/ /g") `


fchar = `echo $userid|cut -c1-1`

# Note need the { } around userid because of the trailing :


echo Doing directory listing for user ${userid}:\<p\>




echo "<table>"
echo "<tr>"
echo "<td>"
# assume student is a grad student


ls -alt /homedir/grad/$fchar/$userid/public_html/websys/

#

echo "</td>"
echo "</tr>"
echo "</table>"



echo "</pre>"

echo "</BODY></HTML>"
